## Development

The project uses vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no build process required. Content is stored in JSON files for easy editing.

### Adding Content

Edit the JSON files in the `data/` directory to add or modify content:
- Each file contains a `title` and `sections` array
- Each section has a `heading` and `text` property

### Customizing Styles

- Main styles: `css/styles.css`
- Dark mode: `css/dark-mode.css`
- Accessibility: `css/accessibility.css`

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6 JavaScript features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Fetch API

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add more comprehensive content to JSON files
- [ ] Implement verse references and cross-references
- [ ] Include multiple Bible translations
- [ ] Add print-friendly styling
- [ ] Implement offline functionality with service workers
